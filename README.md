This repository demonstrates a common error in Python when performing calculations on lists, specifically the TypeError that occurs when the sum() function encounters a non-numeric element in the list.  The bug.py file showcases this error, and bugSolution.py offers a robust solution. The solution includes input validation to handle cases with empty lists and lists containing non-numeric data types, preventing unexpected crashes.
